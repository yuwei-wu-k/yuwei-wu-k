:octocat: I'm a Computer Science grad student at Northeastern University. I'm currently working on my first fullstack project. I consider myself an enthusiastic and adaptable learner. Solving real-world problems in corporate environments is where I thrive, and I love taking on challenges that push my boundaries. 

:seedling: I'm also an active volunteer in LGBTQ and STEM education. Coming from a humanities background, I bring a unique perspective to my work, combining my passion for understanding human nature with a strong analytical mindset.

:computer: I am now seeking opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of innovation. If you're looking for a dedicated and dynamic team member, let's connect!
